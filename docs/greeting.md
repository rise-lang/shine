Welcome to the documentation of the RISE language.
The RISE project, and it's documentation are work in progress.
If you don't find an answer to your questions here please ask them on [GitHub](https://github.com/rise-lang/shine/discussions).

### Starting Point

A good starting point to understand RISE and its compiler is the [Overview Tutorial](tutorial.md).

Technical papers as well as video presentations are available from the [RISE website](https://rise-lang.org/).
The best overview paper to read is: [_Achieving high-performance the functional way: a functional pearl on expressing high-performance optimizations as rewrite strategies_](https://michel.steuwer.info/files/publications/2020/ICFP-2020.pdf) that appeared at ICFP 2020.

If you plan to read or contribute to the code, we have a quick overview of the [file structure](structure.md).
